Releases<BR><BR></STRONG><FONT size=2><U><STRONG>Definitions</STRONG></U> 
</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=verdana size=2>Before you can release your 
deliverables with Excalibur, there are a few terms you need to understand:</P>
<LI><STRONG>Root Deliverable:</STRONG> 
Instead of making you enter a lot of information 
every time you need to release a new version of a deliverable, 
Excalibur collects all of the information that is the same or almost always the 
same&nbsp;across all versions&nbsp;in the Root Deliverable.&nbsp; You can think 
of the Root Deliverable as the place you enter all of the default values 
for&nbsp;new versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this information is entered only once, 
the process of entering all versions (other than the first one) should be 
greatly simplified.&nbsp; 
<LI><STRONG>Deliverable Version:</STRONG> The deliverable version is a 
collection of all of the information about a particular version (version, 
revision, and pass) of a deliverable&nbsp;that you are releasing. This includes 
things like which languages, products, and operating systems&nbsp;are supported 
by the release, vendor version number, Observations fixed and other changes 
made, developer's name, etc.&nbsp; 
<LI><STRONG>HFCN:</STRONG>&nbsp; 
[<font color=red>Note: The HFCN tool should&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;be used for new releases</font>] - HFCN is a legacy tool that was being used 
mainly in Consumer Desktops.&nbsp; It provided release notices for hardware and 
firmware releases.&nbsp; The functionality of that tool has been imported into 
Excalibur to allow developers to release new versions of hardware and 
firmware.&nbsp;&nbsp;

your Root Deliverable has already been entered into Excalibur, skip to <A

    <LI>Items with a red asterisks (<FONT color=red>*</FONT>) are required.
    <LI>Since these screens support many different types of deliverables, you 
    will probably not need to enter information into all of the fields.&nbsp; In 
    general, if you don't know what a field is used for, you probably don't need 
    to use it for your type of deliverable.</LI></OL>
  <LI>On the last screen of the wizard, you are asked if you would like to add 
  this deliverable to your Favorites List.&nbsp; The Favorites Lists is a list 
  of deliverables or products that you work with a lot.&nbsp; It is located in 
  the left pane of the main screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; This list allows you quick 
  access to your deliverables and speeds up the process of releasing deliverable 
  versions.&nbsp; </LI></OL>
