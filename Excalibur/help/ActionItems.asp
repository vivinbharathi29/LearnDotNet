</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=verdana size=2>An Action Item is a record of&nbsp;a 
required&nbsp;action that has been assigned to 
someone in support of the Product Development Process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Action Items&nbsp;can be entered by any 
registered Excalibur user, and they are managed by the PMs of the individual 
products.</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face=verdana size=2>There are several 
different types of action items in Excalibur:</FONT><FONT face=verdana 
size=2>&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Change Request:</STRONG> 
  Once a product is past the POR milestone, any change to the product definition 
  requires the 
         
    approval of a change request by the core 
team.&nbsp; The Change Request is just an action item that contains many additional fields 
designed to prompt the user for the secific types 
of information needed by the core team when evaluating and approving a change to 
their product.&nbsp; Change Requests also have a few 
statuses, workflow steps, and notifications that are not found in other types of 
action items.&nbsp; 
<LI><STRONG>Action Item:</STRONG>      
           
           
   &nbsp;Any action&nbsp;(other than those covered by 
the 3 other action item types) that needs to be tracked 
and completed&nbsp;for any product.&nbsp; 
<LI><STRONG>Issue:</STRONG>&nbsp; 
  Issues are any threat to a product's schedule, scope, or 
  resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues&nbsp;are entered and managed just like Action Items except they 
  are used for very specifc types of actions.&nbsp; 
  Types include: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Risks - Potential impact
    <LI>Issues - Actual impact</LI></UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Status Note:</STRONG>  &nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;line 
  item on the&nbsp;weekly product status report.&nbsp; This can be 
  any status information that the program manager would like to add&nbsp;to 
  the status report.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common use for Status Notes is 
  to list product-level accomplishments for the current week and plans for the coming week.&nbsp; 
  Status notes are automatically closed when they are entered since they are 
  only used for including items in the status reports.</LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>There are several 
fields that are common to most action items:</FONT></P>

  item, you can specify more than one product.&nbsp; A differenct action item 
  will be automatically generated for each product specified in the product list.&nbsp; 
  Action Items are handled this way because each product my accept or reject the 
  item independently and the implemention schedule can be different for each 
  product.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><STRONG>Notify on Approval</STRONG> - An SMTP 
  email list of anyone who should be notified when this item is closed.&nbsp;
