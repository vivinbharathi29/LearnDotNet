  <H1>After Market Option List Overview</H1>

  <P>The After Market Option List shows the Options that are available in IRS. A new Option can be created by 
	selecting the main menu item <b>Modules</b> and from the treeview, selecting the <b>New</b> button. Most of the 
	properties of an option can then be edited on that properties page. The rest of the values will need to be 
	edited on the After Market Option List itself.</p>
	
	<p>Please see the various help pages of the After Market Option List for further information.</p>
